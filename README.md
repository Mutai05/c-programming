## Getting Started

Before you dive into the world of C programming, make sure you have a working C compiler installed on your machine. The recommended compiler is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which is available on most operating systems.

To install GCC on Ubuntu, use the following command:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc

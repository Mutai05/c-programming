# Introduction to C Programming

This repository contains introductory examples of C programming concepts. The two main files included in this repository are `HelloWorld.c` and `Variables.c`.

## HelloWorld.c

`HelloWorld.c` is a simple C program that prints the classic "Hello, World!" message to the console. It serves as a basic example to demonstrate the structure of a C program and how to use the `printf` function to output text.

### Compilation and Execution

To compile and run `HelloWorld.c`:

```bash
gcc HelloWorld.c -o HelloWorld
./HelloWorld

gcc Variables.c -o Variables
./Variables
